# Accenture_Data_Analytics_and_Visualization
Embark on an engaging journey into the realm of data analytics and visualization through the Navigating Numbers virtual internship. This comprehensive program provides a deep dive into fundamental data concepts, including data cleansing, modeling, visualization, and effective storytelling.

## Introduction
Social Buzz, a swiftly growing technology unicorn, requires agile adaptation to its extensive global operations.
Accenture is leading a 3-month Proof of Concept (POC) focused on the following goals:

Conducting an audit of big data practices
Providing recommendations for a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO)
Analyzing data to identify Social Buzz's top 5 most popular content categories

## Task 1: Project Understanding
Quickly get up to speed with the business problem being addressed, project requirements and team alignment.

Read the brief from Social Buzz to:
+ Understand the client and business problem at hand.
+ Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
+ Identify which tasks to focus on as a Data Analyst.


Review the internal stakeholders chart to gain insight into the team's roles and responsibilities.
As a Data Analyst, my assignment involves analyzing sample datasets and creating visualizations to comprehend the popularity of various content categories.


## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
Modeling data to create valuable insights.

Read & understood the data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer the business question: 
Top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

Cleaned the data by:

Eliminating rows containing missing values,
Adjusting the data type of specific values within columns, and
Omitting columns unrelated to this task.


I compiled a consolidated dataset by merging three tables: Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types.
Conducted data modeling by merging these datasets, employing the VLOOKUP formula.
Determined the Top 5 performing categories by aggregating total scores per category, utilizing the SUMIF formula.

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling

I animated the data and extracted valuable business insights. Constructed a PowerPoint presentation to structure the discoveries regarding Social Buzz's content performance. Utilizing PivotTables, crafted data charts that vividly depict the data analysis.
Among the intriguing insights shared were:

+ How many unique categories are there?
+ How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
+ What was the month with the most posts?
